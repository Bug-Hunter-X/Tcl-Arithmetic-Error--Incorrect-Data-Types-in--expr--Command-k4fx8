# Tcl Arithmetic Error: Incorrect Data Types in `expr` Command

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: performing arithmetic operations on strings instead of numbers.  The example code shows how attempting to directly use string inputs with the `expr` command can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  The solution shows how to use type checking and conversion to ensure that your numerical operations work correctly.
